# Best Practices and Optimization

When implementing Makepad animations, there are two key principles to keep in mind: `control` and `smoothness`.

Here are several important best practices:

1. State Management: Always maintain clear animation states, using boolean flags like `is_animating` to track animation status.
2. Performance Optimization:
    - Use `redraw: true` only when redraw is necessary
    - Set reasonable animation durations to avoid overly frequent state updates
3. Error Handling: Consider edge cases during state transitions and frame updates
4. Parameter Configuration: Provide flexible configuration interfaces allowing runtime animation parameter adjustments
