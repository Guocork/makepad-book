# Makepad Studio

`Makepad Studio` offers an IDE for developers and designers, while Makepad Framework is the underlying UI framework.

`Makepad Studio` is crucial as it determines the user experience for developers.

In UI-intensive projects, the biggest cost factor comes from the disconnect between designers and developers. Designers need to convey their ideas to product managers, who in turn communicate with developers. Developers need to inform designers of limitations. Continuous feedback requires a lot of effort, and information can get lost. In the future intelligent era, designers will need to convey more information to AI. As Makepad Studio's creative tools mature, designers will increasingly be able to build complex and refined interfaces.
