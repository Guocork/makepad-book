# Makepad Framework

However, so far, when we refer to `Makepad`, we mainly mean `Makepad Framework`, and the content of this book also focuses primarily on `Makepad Framework`. 

 It is actively being developed but is already usable for building rapid prototypes and simple (even complex) UI applications.

> Currently the most active branch of `makepad` is https://github.com/makepad/makepad/tree/rik
