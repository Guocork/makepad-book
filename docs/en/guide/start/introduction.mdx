Makepad is an in-development shader based live designable OSS UI-Framework

## Makepad Book Introduction

The Book of Makepad is aimed to Makepad application developers and contributors. It systematically introduces various aspects of the Rust cross-platform Makepad UI framework.

## Makepad Introduction

The ultimate vision of Makepad is to build a livecoding/design hybrid IDE. Just like Visual Basic or Delphi once unified developers and designers. But different from them, Makepad is implemented in Rust and including a design tool similar to Figma.

:::info Background of Makepad

Makepad was born six years ago (2019). You can visit the [makepad history](https://github.com/makepad/makepad_history) repository to learn about the original vision of Makepad.

The creator of Makepad is Rik Arends. This name may not be familiar to many people, but you must have heard of Cloud9 IDE and the ACE code editor.

- [Cloud9 IDE](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/cloud9/)ï¼š Founded in 2010 and sold to Amazon in 2016, it is a cloud IDE, an open-source integrated development environment based on the cloud. It supports more than 40 languages, including PHP and Ruby, Python, and JavaScript/Node.js. It is almost entirely written in JavaScript and uses Node.js for the backend.

- [Ace](https://ace.c9.io/)ï¼š An independent code editor written in JavaScript. Its goal is to create a web-based code editor that matches and extends the functionality, usability, and performance of existing native editors (such as TextMate, Vim, or Eclipse). It can be easily embedded into any web page and JavaScript application. Ace was developed as the primary editor for Cloud9 IDE and is the successor to the Mozilla Skywriter project.

When creating these two products, Rik Arends used common web front-end technologies based on HTML/CSS/Javascript. He thought that using HTML as the UI for an IDE was simply madness, and he was deeply frustrated. For example, the code folding animations he wanted to implement were extremely difficult to achieve with HTML and other front-end technologies.

Moreover, the performance of web front-end technologies was also very slow. Therefore, he decided to reimplement a native UI framework using Rust.

The demo showcased in the video below demonstrates this vision.

This online demo for makepad studio is not up to date, you can download the newest version from [here](https://crates.io/crates/makepad-studio).

As seen in the video: the code, 3D tree, and design icons can all be linked in real-time, and the video ends with an impressive code collapse animation.

To achieve this vision, `Makepad` needs to provide two main components:

- [Makepad Framework](/guide/start/makepad-framework)
- [Makepad Studio](/guide/start/makepad-studio)

## Advantages

### Performance Matters

- Software should be a joy to use

    When developers focus on their expertise, quality improves. And Makepad's design-editor will let designers themselves bring UIs to the next level.

- App downloads should be fast

    Filesize matters for products that also run on the web. Makepad projects are tiny. 

- Work should be done only once

    Writing cross platform specific code is time consuming. Makepad projects share identical code across web and native.

### Better Workflows Lead to Better Products

- Mockups should be a thing of the past

    When developers focus on their expertise, quality improves. And Makepad's design-editor will let designers themselves bring UIs to the next level.

- Workflows should be streamlined

    The thrill of actualizing a fantastic idea deserves safeguarding. Makepad's roadblock-free development experience safeguards motivation.

- Development should be interruption-free

    Rapid compile times preserve mental flow. Makepad proves that Rust can compile stunningly fast â€” and its live design system is even instantaneous.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Makepad's Technology Stack
**There is no such thing as a perfect tech stack in the world; everything is just a trade-off.** Makepad has also developed under these constant trade-offs. It has its own strengths and weaknesses.

### Rust

- Advantages

    Rust offers many advantages, such as high performance, safety, a strong type system, predictable runtime, a robust package manager, seamless ABI compatibility with C, and a single compiler maintained officially (no need to consider multiple compilers like in C/C++), These are reasons for choosing Rust.

- Disadvantages

    However, developing applications in Rust is relatively more challenging compared to languages with garbage collection like C#, Java, Kotlin, or JavaScript, and the developer user base is relatively smaller. Additionally, the ecosystem for UI in Rust is still not mature, which poses challenges for adopting Rust.

### Use Shaders to Render UI Styles

- Advantages

    Makepad uses shaders to render UI styles due to their high performance and powerful functionality.

- Disadvantages

    - However, there are significant drawbacks: high power consumption, especially when the screen area is large. 
    - The shader language also adds a learning burden, and shader compilation times can be slow.

### Hybrid Immediate Mode

- Advantages

    - Update the UI when data changes is very simple from a coding perspective.
    - Layouts are also simpler.

- Disadvantages

    - It's a different paradigm than Swfit/ Flutter / React and requires a learning cost.
    - The layout model is also unlike Flexbox or Flutter's model, but it is extensible.


### Render Stack

- Advantages

    Utilizes the GPU to accelerate the UI, making it easy to integrate design capabilities into the system.

- Disadvantages

    The downside is that font rendering needs to be redone, requiring loading of TTF files, and it increases the package size for web/mobile devices. It is difficult to integrate with systems that only provide high-level rendering structures (such as HTML or native UI toolkits) for native functionality and accessibility (an advantage of React Native). Bridging more and more native APIs to Rust/Makepad is a significant task.
