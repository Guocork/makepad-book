Makepad is an in-development shader based live designable OSS UI-Framework

## Makepad Book Introduction

The Book of Makepad, aimed at Makepad application developers and contributors, systematically introduces various aspects of the Rust cross-platform Makepad UI framework.

## Makepad Introduction

The ultimate vision of Makepad is to build a livecoding/design hybrid IDE. Similar to how tools like Visual Basic or Delphi once unified developers and designers, Makepad, implemented in Rust, offers functionalities akin to design tools like Figma.

The demo showcased in the video below demonstrates this vision.

Online Demo (outdated):[https://makepad.dev/](https://makepad.dev/)  
This online demo for makepad studio is not up to date, you can download the newest version from [here](https://crates.io/crates/makepad-studio).

As seen in the video: the code, 3D tree, and design icons can all be linked in real-time, and the video ends with an impressive code collapse animation.

To achieve this vision, `Makepad` needs to provide two main components:

- [Makepad Framework](/guide/start/makepad-framework)
- [Makepad Studio](/guide/start/makepad-studio)

## Advantages

### Performance Matters

- Software should be a joy to use

    When developers focus on their expertise, quality improves. And Makepad's design-editor will let designers themselves bring UIs to the next level.

- App downloads should be fast

    Filesize matters for products that also run on the web. Makepad projects are tiny. Check out our [pre-alpha IDE](http://www.makepad.dev/) live on the web.

- Work should be done only once

    Writing cross platform specific code is time consuming. Makepad projects share identical code across web and native.

### Better Workflows Lead to Better Products

- Mockups should be a thing of the past

    When developers focus on their expertise, quality improves. And Makepad's design-editor will let designers themselves bring UIs to the next level.

- Workflows should be streamlined

    The thrill of actualizing a fantastic idea deserves safeguarding. Makepad's roadblock-free development experience safeguards motivation.

- Development should be interruption-free

    Rapid compile times preserve mental flow. Makepad proves that Rust can compile stunningly fast â€” and its live design system is even instantaneous.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Makepad's Technology Stack

### Rust

- Advantages

    Rust offers many advantages, such as high performance, safety, a strong type system, predictable runtime, a robust package manager, seamless ABI compatibility with C, and a single compiler maintained officially (no need to consider multiple compilers like in C/C++), These are reasons for choosing Rust.

- Disadvantages

    However, developing applications in Rust is relatively more challenging compared to languages with garbage collection like C#, Java, Kotlin, or JavaScript, and the developer user base is relatively smaller. Additionally, the ecosystem for UI in Rust is still not mature, which poses challenges for adopting Rust.

### Use Shaders to Render UI Styles

- Advantages

    Makepad uses shaders to render UI styles due to their high performance and powerful functionality.

- Disadvantages

    - However, there are significant drawbacks: high power consumption, especially when the screen area is large. 
    - The shader language also adds a learning burden, and shader compilation times can be slow.

### Hybrid Immediate Mode

- Advantages

    - Update the UI when data changes is very simple from a coding perspective.
    - Layouts are also simpler.

- Disadvantages

    - It's a different paradigm than Swfit/ Flutter / React and requires a learning cost.
    - The layout model is also unlike Flexbox or Flutter's model, but it is extensible.


### Render Stack

- Advantages

    Utilizes the GPU to accelerate the UI, making it easy to integrate design capabilities into the system.

- Disadvantages

    The downside is that font rendering needs to be redone, requiring loading of TTF files, and it increases the package size for web/mobile devices. It is difficult to integrate with systems that only provide high-level rendering structures (such as HTML or native UI toolkits) for native functionality and accessibility (an advantage of React Native). Bridging more and more native APIs to Rust/Makepad is a significant task.
