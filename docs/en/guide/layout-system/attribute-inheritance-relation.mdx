# Layout Property Inheritance Relationships

An important concept is the inheritance and override mechanism for layout properties.

## Walk Properties Do Not Inherit

- Each component must explicitly define its own Walk properties
- Child component Walk properties are completely independent of parent components

## Layout Properties Partially Inherit

- `flow` direction influences child components' default behavior
- `spacing` applies between sibling child components
- `alignment` affects all child components' positioning

```rust
// Layout property inheritance example
Parent = <View> {
    layout: {
        flow: Down,
        align: {x: 0.5} // All child components default to horizontal center alignment
    },

    <Child1> {
        // Inherits parent's flow and align
    }

    <Child2> {
        layout: {
            align: {x: 1.0} // Overrides inherited alignment, changes to right alignment
        }
    }
}
```
