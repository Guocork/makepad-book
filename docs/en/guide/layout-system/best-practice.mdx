# Best Practice Recommendations

**Clear Size Hierarchy**

- Use explicit size constraints for top-level containers
- Avoid deep Fit nesting

**Single Direction Dependency Principle**

- Maintain one-way layout dependencies
- Use Fixed and Fill to establish clear constraints

**Component Design Principles**

- Components should have clear sizing strategies
- Provide reasonable defaults and fallback options

**Performance Optimization**

- Use CachedView to cache stable layouts
- Avoid unnecessary dynamic layout calculations

By understanding and following these principles, we can create more stable and efficient layout systems. In practical development, maintaining layout simplicity and predictability is key.
