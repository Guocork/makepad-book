# Basic Concepts

`Layout` and `Walk` are the two most fundamental concepts in Makepad's layout system, working together to determine how components are positioned and sized.

- **Walk**: Defines how a component "walks" within its parent container, determining its own size and position
- **Layout**: Defines how a component "arranges" its child components when acting as a container

Let's understand this through an analogy:

- Walk is like a person deciding how much space they need and where to stand in a room
- Layout is like that person, as a room host, deciding how to arrange seating for their guests

The term `Walk` is used because `Turtle Draw` is the core mechanism of Makepad's layout system, inspired by classic Turtle Graphics. 

This layout approach allows us to determine component position and size by having a "turtle" walk across the canvas.

## Detailed Comparison

### Walk Properties

```rust
walk: {
    width: Fill,      // Width behavior in parent container
    height: Fixed(50), // Height behavior in parent container
    margin: {         // Spacing from other components
        left: 10,
        right: 10,
        top: 5,
        bottom: 5
    }
}
```
Key characteristics of `Walk`:

1. Externally oriented - Determines how the component positions itself within its parent
2. Passive calculation - Size is determined jointly by parent container and own properties
3. Margin control - Maintains spacing from other components through margins

### Layout Properties

```rust
layout: {
    flow: Down,       // Child component arrangement direction
    spacing: 10,      // Spacing between child components
    padding: {        // Internal spacing
        left: 10,
        right: 10,
        top: 5,
        bottom: 5
    },
    align: {          // Child component alignment
        x: 0.5,       // Horizontal center
        y: 0.0        // Top alignment
    }
}
```

Key characteristics of `Layout`:

1. Internally oriented - Determines how to manage child components
2. Active layout - Directly controls child component arrangement
3. Internal space - Controls content area through padding

## Collaborative Working Mechanism

Let's examine how they work together through an example:

```rust
Container = <View> {
    // Determines container's behavior in parent
    walk: {
        width: Fill,        // Fill parent container width
        height: Fit,        // Height adapts to content
        margin: 10         // 10px margin on all sides
    },

    // Determines how to arrange child components
    layout: {
        flow: Down,        // Vertical arrangement of children
        spacing: 5,        // 5px spacing between children
        padding: 15,       // 15px internal padding
        align: {x: 0.5}    // Horizontally center children
    },

    // Child components
    <Button> {
        walk: {
            width: Fixed(100),  // Fixed 100px width
            height: Fixed(40)   // Fixed 40px height
        }
    }

    <Button> {
        walk: {
            width: Fixed(100),
            height: Fixed(40)
        }
    }
}
```

Layout calculation process:

1. Container's Walk determines its own Fill width and Fit height within parent
2. Container's Layout decides children will be vertically arranged and centered
3. Each Button's Walk determines its own fixed 100x40 size
4. Finally, Container's height is calculated as:
    - padding.top (15px)
    - Button1 height (40px)
    - spacing (5px)
    - Button2 height (40px)
    - padding.bottom (15px)
    - Total: 115px
