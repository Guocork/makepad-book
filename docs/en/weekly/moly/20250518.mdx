# Moly V0.2.1 Released

> Author: AlexZhang

Moly v0.2.1 has been released (this is a completely new version different from the previously released version) https://github.com/moxin-org/moly/releases/tag/v0.2.1

Here are the latest updates:

This release primarily includes UI improvements focused on text and animations.

- Improved font sizing, generally using larger text in the chat interface and increased spacing
- Updated provider model versions and added newer models
- Introduced smooth typing animation for bot messages
- Improved model selector animation
- Provider synchronization improvements
- Made MolyKit independent of DeepInquire-related components
- Synchronized with Makepad updates, fixing numerous UI issues

## Build and Platform Support

We have successfully completed signing for macOS arm platform. As we discussed with Cassaundra, signing for other platforms is not as necessary as it is for macOS (for example, on Windows you can dismiss warnings, and on Linux there are no issues at all). For Windows, setting up a third-party certificate would be required, typically costing between 300-1000 USD per year.

Currently, builds for Linux and Windows still have some issues due to problems in Makepad, including resource loading, SVG rendering issues, animation problems on Linux, and some issues with the portal list. I'm synchronizing the latest Makepad code in my branch again to see if these issues have been resolved (I'm tracking relevant discussions across various channels).

For Windows users, you'll typically only encounter regular application trust warnings, or specific firewall/antivirus software might issue warnings, but we haven't encountered any other major problems.

## Development Progress

### Improved Logging

We have added more comprehensive logging for both the UI and terminal, making troubleshooting for regular providers and DeepInquire much easier.

### MolyKit Documentation

@noxware has been documenting MolyKit, and you can now find the documentation at: [https://moxin-org.github.io/moly/](https://moxin-org.github.io/moly/)

We may consider placing MolyKit in a separate repository, separating it from Moly. MolyKit code is located at: [https://github.com/moxin-org/moly/tree/main/moly-kit](https://github.com/moxin-org/moly/tree/main/moly-kit)

### Development Branch Changes

We are now developing on the `main` branch of Moly. Recently, we've integrated many large unstable works simultaneously: backend rework, threading changes, Mofa, support for 3rd party providers, MolyKit reworking all main features, etc., which is why we previously kept these on the `dev` branch to maintain stability in the `main` branch.

Since we shouldn't have as many breaking changes from now on (and won't receive frequent breaking changes from WasmEdge as we did before), we can temporarily return to working on the `main` branch.

### Latest Feature Improvements

Most of the changes over the past week have been about stabilizing features, but we've also added some new content:

- Added a progress bar animation when synchronizing providers at startup (also applies when you change your API keys or enable/disable providers). This process is usually quick, unless you're using SilliconFlow, which is noticeably slower when fetching models and interacting with them. The progress bar is located in the model selector.
- We introduced a "smooth typing" animation to make text streaming look less clunky, especially for very fast models (like Gemini flash) that output large amounts of text all at once. We will further improve this in the future by introducing text fade-in effects similar to OpenAI.
