# Setting Up the Development Environment

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

## Preparations

Makepad Book is built using Rust and Rspress

### Installing Rust

- Please use [official Rust installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install Rust。
- If you are using VS Code，we highly recommend [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) extension.

### Run the project

The Makepad Book uses `pnpm` as the package management tool.

Please refer to the [official pnpm installation guide](https://pnpm.io/zh/installation) to install pnpm.

:::tip tip

If you have already installed npm or yarn, you can use npm or yarn to install pnpm.

<PackageManagerTabs command="install -g pnpm" />

:::

In practice, you only need to run the following commands:


```bash
pnpm install  # Install dependencies
pnpm run dev  # Start the project
```
