# Hello Makepad

A very simple example of a Makepad Framework application, used to illustrate the basic concepts of Makepad Framework.

This example is a simple counter case that adds and subtracts by adding 1 and subtracting 1 buttons.

The code for this example is fairly well commented, so it should be a good starting point for playing around with Makepad Framework.
